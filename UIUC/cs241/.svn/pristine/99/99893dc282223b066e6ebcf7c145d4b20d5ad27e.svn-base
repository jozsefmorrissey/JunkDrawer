For each Coffman condition, describe one way to break only that condition
and no others in the COMPANY AND INTERN SCENARIO (Label what condition you are breaking).

For each of the following scenarios answer:
    Is this

Please run the simulation in the following ways and answer the respective questions:

    Experiment 1: Run the bad solution with 5 companies and 5 interns
        What happens?
            Response Here:
        Why?
            Response Here:

    Experiment 2: Run the bad solution with 5 companies and 15 interns. Notice that it no longer deadlocks.
        Why is this (which of the Coffman Condition(s) did we break)?
            Response Here:
        For N companies what is the minimum number of interns do you need to break the same condition(s)?
            Response Here:

    Experiment 3: Run the bad solution with 2 companies and 2 interns, then 20 companies and 20 interns several times each.
        Which deadlocks faster?
            Response Here:
        Why is that?
